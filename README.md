For doing technical analysis for option traders, the Option Chain is the most important tool for deciding entry and exit
strategies. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) has a website which displays the option chain for traders in near
real-time. This program retrieves this data from the NSE site and then generates useful analysis of the Option Chain for
the specified Index or Stock. It also continuously refreshes the Option Chain and visually displays the trend in various
indicators useful for Technical Analysis. Calculations are based
on [Mr. Sameer Dharaskar's Course](http://advancesharetrading.com/).

## Notes:

- If there is an error in fetching dates on login screen then try refreshing

- If there is an error in fetching dates on main screen then try stopping and again starting from option menu

- If you face any issue or have a suggestion then feel free to open an issue.

- It is recommended to enable logging and then send the `NSE-OCA.log` file or the console output for reporting issues

- In case of network or connection errors the program doesn't crash and will keep retrying until manually stopped

- If a `ZeroDivisionError` occurs or some data doesn't exist the value of the variable will be defaulted to `0`

- Set `load_nse_icon` option to `False` in the configuration file to prevent downloading the NSE icon in the `.py`
  version to speed up loading time

- If an `Incorrect Strike Price` error message is displayed and the strike price you entered is correct then check
  whether the NSE website is loading the data properly before creating an issue

| Open Interest                | This indicates if the latest OI data record indicates Bearish or Bullish signs near Indicated Strike Price. If the Call Sum is more than the Put Sum then the OI is considered Bearish as there is more Call writing than Puts. If the Put Sum is more than the Call sum then the OI Is considered Bullish as the Put writing exceeds the Call writing.                                                                     |

| Call Exits                   | This indicates if the Call writers are exiting near given Strike Price in the latest OI data record. If the Call sum is < 0 or if the change in Call OI at the Call boundary (2 Strike Prices above the given Strike Price) is < 0, then Call writers are exiting their positions and the Bulls have a clear path.                                                                                                          |
| Put Exits                    | This indicates if the Put writers are exiting near given Strike Price in the latest OI data record. If the Put sum is < 0 or if the change in Put OI at the Put boundary (the given Strike Price) is < 0, then Put writers are exiting their positions and the Bears have a clear path.                                                                                                                                     |
| Call In The Money(ITM)       | This indicates if the Call writers are also exiting far OTM strike prices (4 Strike Prices above the given Strike Price) showing extreme bullishness. Conditions are if the Call writers are exiting their far OTM positions and the Put writers are writing at the same Strike Price & if the absolute ratio > 1.5 then it's bullish sign. This signal also changes to Yes if the change in Call OI at the far OTM is < 0. |
| Put In The Money(ITM)        | This indicates if the Put writers are also exiting far OTM strike prices (2 Strike Prices below the given Strike Price) showing extreme bearishness. Conditions are if the Put writers are exiting their far OTM positions and the Call writers are writing at the same Strike Price & if the absolute ratio > 1.5 then it's a bearish sign.
